PITCH OUTLINE:



With advent of sequencing as users we want to improve not only our health but that of friends, family, and everyone!


Engineering questions:
-Actionability (how do i use my genetic information?)
-Interpretability (what does this mean for my health?)


SOLUTION
Beautiful app people will want to use to manage their prescriptions and give feedback in real time.



We are logged in. Personal genomic data.
Look at our current prescriptions.
	show genomic risk factor.
	All information from published DBs.

Give feedback on efficacy.
	Feel worse.
	Tracking all of this.
	Valuable time series data

Let’s add a drug to our repertoire
	Uses published drug-drug conflicts

I’m concerned export data to show to physician.
	Relevant Genetic make up
	Can help us more efficiently.


Further Incentivize people to engage with the app via gamification or product rewards.
These data are brand new!
Best drugs for me.
Understanding side effects unique to me.
Forming communities around these data.
Supportive communities around similar medical outcomes.

Rx.me is beautiful and fun way to use my genetic information to improve my health and health of the community.





NEXT STEPS:



Doctor-facing app.
Opioid specific workflow.


QUESTIONS:
	Money? Sell the data.
	Recreational Drugs? Why the hell not?
	Use encryption. Signal protocol. 
	Liability? Big disclaimer at the start.
	Why open? Diary of your health.
